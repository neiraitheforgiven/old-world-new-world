		<English>      I am Tadodaho, first Fire Keeper of the Haudenosaunee, who are often called the Iroquois. I was the last chief to sign on to the Great Law of Peace, and its greatest obstacle, for I loved the ways of war and opposed it with my cruel might and dark sorcery. But eventually even I heard to the words of the Peacemaker and his envoy, Hiawatha, snapping out of my madness, and allowed the snakes to be combed from my hair.

		As tribute to my finally partaking in the Great Law of Peace, which bound together the Five Nations of the Haudenosaunee into a unified confederacy, the Haudenosaunee have since always given their spiritual leaders my name.</English>
